The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a paradigmatic lattice model for one-dimensional particle transport subject to excluded-volume interactions. Solving the inhomogeneous TASEP in which particles' hopping rates vary across the lattice is a long-standing problem. In recent years, a power series approximation (PSA) has been developed to tackle this problem, however no computer algorithm currently exists that implements this approximation. This paper addresses this issue by providing a Python-based package TASEPy that finds the steady state solution of the inhomogeneous TASEP for any set of hopping rates using the PSA truncated at a user-defined order.
